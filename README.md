# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction



## 📝 Description

This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset of hotel bookings, the model aims to identify the key factors influencing cancellations and accurately predict whether a booking will be canceled. By understanding these patterns, hotels can optimize their resource allocation, improve revenue management strategies, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. While specific tech stack details and features are currently unavailable, the project's core objective is to provide actionable insights into cancellation behavior through predictive modeling.
